This file is to document the process I went through to clean the audible dataset in Excel/Google Sheets.
    Converted Price colum from Indian Rupee to U.S. Dollar 1 to 0.012 ratio.
      Formated colum into currency.
    Separateded Star rating and number of ratings into individual colums
      Used LEFT and RIGHT fucntions to isolate each half of the string
    Fixed the Language colums formating by using the fuction =PROPER(F2)
      Used this to fix uncapitalized words
    Standardized the Releasedate Colum into DD-MMM-YYYY format
      Accomplished this with the custom date and time formating tool
    Changed the Time colum into Length in Mins
      Converted the format from __hrs__mins to just minutes
      Accomplished by using the function =SPLIT(D2,CONCATENATE(SPLIT(D2,".0123456789")))
      New colums of Hrs and mins where created 
      Calaculated the final length in minutes =(E2*60)+F2
    Spaced out First, middle, and last names of authors and narrators colums
      Removed the Writtenby/Narratedby: from each cell in each colum with =REPLACE(C2,1,10,""), =REPLACE(C2,1,10,"")
      Utilized the function =REGEXREPLACE(B2,"(\B)([A-Z])"," $0")
      This did come with the unintended side effect separating some unwanted names
      Example: Mcwilliams becomes Mc Williams.
